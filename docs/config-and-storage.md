# Config, storage & API reference

Relational config tables, the per-resource config REST, backup/restore, node monitoring, and the REST endpoint summary (`s.routes()` in `internal/api/server.go` is authoritative).

## Config management (web UI)

The sidebar has **Bots** / **Repeater** / **MQTT** (Comms) and **Settings**
(System) plus add/edit/delete on the Companions page (the chat header's
"edit" action deep-links there via `?edit=<name>`). Each edits **one resource** through
the per-resource config REST (`/api/config/*`): pages fetch only the slice
they need (`hooks/useApiObject` for single-row settings/mqtt, `hooks/useApiList`
for the lists) and write through `lib/configApi.ts`. There is **no
whole-document fetch or PUT** — the old `GET/PUT /api/config` (and
`hooks/useConfig.ts`) were removed because the GET shipped every secret to the
browser. Read DTOs are **secret-redacted** (`privateKeySet` / `passwordSet`
booleans); a write **omits** a secret field to keep the stored value, sends it
to set, sends `""` to clear.

Server-side, every write goes through `backend.configMutate`
(`internal/app/config_rest.go`): inside one `WriteSync` it loads the current
row snapshot (`configRows`), applies the change in memory, **assembles +
`Validate()`s the whole config BEFORE persisting** (by surrogate id), then
reloads. So an invalid edit is rejected before it touches the DB, and a
rename/key-rotation keeps the row's id. Reloads are diff-based
(`reloadCompanions` in `internal/app/app.go`): only companions whose
*effective* block changed are restarted — unchanged ones keep running,
sessions intact, no re-advert; log-level changes apply with zero restarts. A
radio/connection change still restarts everything (modem reconnect);
`listenAddr` needs a process restart.

- **Config is stored relationally** (the config tables: `settings`,
  `mqtt_settings`, `mqtt_brokers`, `companions`, `companion_channels`,
  `triggers`, `trigger_channels` — all with surrogate INTEGER ids so name /
  pubkey / private_key are mutable columns nothing references). The
  assemble/disassemble seam between these rows and the in-memory
  `*config.Config` the runtime consumes lives in `internal/app/config_tables.go`
  (`loadConfigRows` → `assembleFromRows`; `writeConfigToTables` disassembles).
  The legacy `app_config` JSON blob table is **dormant**: the baseline schema
  still creates it, but `initConfigTables` reads it only on a never-initialized
  DB (no `settings` row) to import a pre-relational blob, and no live DB has one
  left to import.
- **The database is the source of truth.** Config files are one-time imports
  (`internal/app/config.go` `resolveConfig`): an explicit `-config path` flag
  imports and **overwrites** the stored config; otherwise the DB wins; a first
  run imports a default-named file from the cwd or bootstraps a quiet default
  (zero companions — the first-run wizard creates one). SIGHUP reloads from
  the DB.
- **Legacy config-file format is import-compatible.** The pre-relational ("main"
  deployment) format used `nodeType`, `[[bot]]`/`[[bot.trigger]]`, and
  `[[observer]]`/`[observer.broker]`; `migrateLegacyFormat` (in
  `internal/config/legacy.go`, run first in `ApplyDefaults`) folds those into
  `connectionType` / `[[companion]]` / a single top-level `[mqtt]` so an
  existing deployed config imports without dropping the bot or MQTT feed. A
  bot and an observer **sharing a name are the same node**: the observer is
  matched to that companion (else a companion is created), its `keyFile` seed
  becomes the companion's identity (via the `KeyFile`→`PrivateKey`
  `MigrateKeyFiles` path) and its `[advert]` its position. Legacy broker
  `ws`/`wss` transports normalize to `websockets` (`wss` implies TLS); the
  canonical schema and `BrokerConfig.Validate` only know `tcp`/`websockets`.
- **Validation is the crash guard.** A `startCompanions` failure after reload
  **exits the process**, so `Config.Validate()` must reject anything that
  would fail companion construction: trigger type/template/regex/cron,
  channel privateKey hex, duplicate companion names (the API routes and the
  runtime registry still key by name, so names must be unique even though
  storage keys by id), mqtt node references, broker fields.
  `configMutate` runs this on the assembled config before persisting.
  `TriggerConfig.Validate` parse-checks templates with stubbed trigger funcs
  (`formatPathBytes`) — extend the stubs if the templater gains functions.
- **MQTT is top-level, one node.** `Config.Mqtt` (`mqtt.node` selects the
  feeding companion, empty = first; `enabled` nil = on). Stored as
  `mqtt_settings.node_companion_id` (a real FK, ON DELETE SET NULL) and
  resolved to the companion **name** in `assembleFromRows` — so renaming the
  feed node no longer breaks the reference. The MqttPage node selector is by
  companion id. Legacy per-companion `[companion.mqtt]` blocks are hoisted by
  `ApplyDefaults` on load — first one wins. At runtime `startCompanions` copies
  the block into the selected companion's config; `CompanionConfig.Mqtt` is
  otherwise deprecated.
- **Broker topics are templates.** `broker.packetTopic` / `broker.statusTopic`
  take placeholders `{iata} {pubkey} {name}` (meshcoretomqtt's `{IATA}` /
  `{PUBLIC_KEY}` uppercase forms also resolve); empty = the old hardcoded
  `meshcore/{iata}/{pubkey}/<kind>`. The deprecated `topicPrefix` field is
  folded into explicit templates by `ApplyDefaults` (`migrateTopicPrefix`).
  Resolution is `resolveTopics` in `internal/mqtt/observer.go` — the LWT in
  `connectBroker` must use the same resolution as the live status publisher.
  Templates are validated in `BrokerConfig.Validate` (unknown placeholders,
  MQTT wildcards). **Broker connection state is surfaced**:
  `GET /api/mqtt/status` returns every *configured* enabled broker with
  `connected` (read from paho's own `IsConnected`, so its auto-reconnect needs
  no tracking), `lastError`, `connectedTs`, and publish/drop counts; the
  MqttPage polls it every 5 s for the per-broker pill. It lists configured
  brokers rather than live clients on purpose — a broker that never connected
  must stay visible. **A failed initial connect retries** (`retryConnect`,
  5 s doubling to 5 min, guarded by `brokerClient.retrying`): paho's
  `SetAutoReconnect` only covers a client that connected at least once, so
  without it a broker that was down at startup stayed down until the process
  restarted. The same loop rescues a failed token-refresh reconnect, which
  otherwise stranded the broker until the next refresh tick (0.8 x token
  lifetime). `doPublish` skips a disconnected client and counts a drop —
  publishing to one would block for `publishWaitTimeout` per job and stall the
  worker. Per-broker auth: `token` (Ed25519 JWT from the node
  identity, username `v1_<pubkey>`, 10-min lifetime, minted fresh on every connect/reconnect via paho's `CredentialsProvider` plus a refresh tick) or `basic`
  (user/pass). The Add Broker modal has presets (`BROKER_PRESETS` in
  `MqttPage.tsx`) mirroring meshcoretomqtt's: LetsMesh US/EU, Waev A/B,
  MeshMapper — update there if upstream endpoints change.
- **`ChannelRef` JSON gotcha**: it implements `UnmarshalText` (TOML string
  form), which makes encoding/json demand a string — `ChannelList`'s
  `UnmarshalJSON` therefore decodes objects into a tag-equivalent anonymous
  struct. Don't "simplify" it back to unmarshalling `ChannelRef` directly;
  that breaks JSON config-file import and the legacy-blob migration. (The API
  no longer round-trips `ChannelRef` — triggers reference channels by id via
  `trigger_channels`.)
- **Companion identity** is the `companions.private_key` column (64-hex
  ed25519 seed; `pubkey` is a derived, cached column). On create with a blank
  key, `SaveCompanion` generates one (`config.GenerateSeedHex`); on update it
  inherits the stored key from the row snapshot when the write omits it, so an
  edit can never silently rotate a running identity (no more
  `inheritCompanionKeys` — each resource owns its secret-keep logic). Keys are
  never sent to the browser (`privateKeySet` boolean only). Legacy `keyFile`
  entries are read and inlined at file import (`MigrateKeyFiles`). **Renaming a
  companion is fully safe**: every per-companion table — config references
  (mqtt node id, trigger channels) *and* history (messages, contacts,
  conversation reads, blocked senders) — keys on the surrogate
  `companions.id`, not the name. The history tables carry an INTEGER
  `companion_id` FK (`ON DELETE CASCADE`) and the runtime threads the id via
  `CompanionConfig.ID` / `Companion.ID()`. The
  API keeps `{name}` in its URLs and resolves it to the id per request
  (`CompanionRepo.IDByName`, `Server.companionID`). `node_state.companion_id`
  is the lone exception: it stays a name (node-keyed, self-heals each poll).

## Backup & restore

Export/import so a non-technical operator can move a node to new hardware
without hand-copying `meshcore.db`. UI is `BackupWizard` (opened from
`BackupPanel` on Settings) for export, and `RestoreFromBackup` inside
`SetupWizard` for restore. Logic: `internal/app/backup.go` over
`internal/store/backup.go`.

- **Restore is first-run only, by design.** Applying a backup to a node that is
  already configured and on the air is what breaks: identities collide,
  contacts half-overwrite, live sessions dangle. So the Settings panel is
  export-only and says where restore lives; the wizard's welcome step offers
  "Restore a backup" beside "Begin". **Don't add a restore button to Settings.**
- **A backup is a pruned copy of the database**, not a per-table dump:
  `VACUUM INTO` a temp file, `store.PruneBackup` deletes what the operator did
  not select, then `VACUUM` so the file actually shrinks (3.4 MB → 208 KB with
  history excluded). One format, and it restores through the whole-file swap.
  Companion pruning relies on `ON DELETE CASCADE`, so `PRAGMA foreign_keys`
  must be on in the copy — deleting a companion is what removes its channels,
  contacts and messages.
- **Restoring cannot overwrite the live file** (this process holds it open), so
  `StageRestore` writes `meshcore.db.restore` and `AdoptPendingRestore` (called
  from `Run` *before* `store.Open`) renames it into place on the next start,
  keeping the outgoing DB as `meshcore.db.replaced` and deleting the stale
  `-wal`/`-shm` — leaving those would corrupt the adopted DB. The API returns
  `restartRequired: true`.
- **The companion selection is always explicit.** `companionIds` is exactly
  what to keep: `[]` is none (a settings-only backup), every id is all. It is
  **required** — an omitted or `null` field is a 400, not a default, which is
  why the API DTO types it `*[]int64` and `decodeBackupOptions` fills in no
  defaults at all. Absent must never mean "all": a caller that forgets the
  field would silently get the largest possible backup, and the nil-vs-empty
  distinction does not survive re-serialization or a non-Go client. It keys on
  the surrogate id, not the name, like the rest of the config REST. An unknown
  id simply matches nothing.
- **Identity keys are opt-in** and govern `companions.private_key` /
  `repeater.private_key` only; channel keys are shared channel secrets, not
  identities, so they always travel. When excluded, `PruneBackup` blanks the
  columns and **`mintMissingKeys` (in `resolveConfig`) generates and persists
  new ones at startup** — required, because `Config.Validate` treats two blank
  keys as duplicates and would stop the process from starting.
- `POST /api/backup/estimate` counts what a selection captures using the same
  predicates `PruneBackup` deletes by, so the wizard can show what including
  the packet log costs before building the file. `Bytes` is the live DB size,
  i.e. an upper bound.
- **Day windows** are `-1` all, `0` none, or N days (`store.DaysAll` /
  `DaysNone`). They apply to `packets.received_at` and `messages.timestamp`
  (DATETIME) and `node_metrics.ts` / `node_neighbors.ts` (unix seconds) — hence
  the `datetime('now',?)` vs `unixepoch('now',?)` split.
- **Import sniffs the upload**: the `SQLite format 3\0` magic means a backup
  (staged); anything else goes through `importConfigFile`, so an operator can
  also bring an old `.toml`/`.yaml`/`.json` config across through the UI. The
  filename only picks the parser.
- **A backup carries secrets** — channel keys, broker credentials, saved
  repeater passwords — so the export sets `Cache-Control: no-store` and both
  the wizard and the panel say so.
- **Import validates before touching anything**: `InspectBackup` requires a
  readable SQLite file with a `settings` table and `user_version <=`
  `LatestSchemaVersion()` (migrations never run backwards); a rejected upload
  leaves nothing staged.

## Node monitoring

A type-agnostic poller (`internal/monitor`) polls monitored contacts on a staggered schedule → `node_metrics` (time-series) + `node_state` (latest snapshot, JSON `metric→value`). Gotchas:

- **Kind resolution is peer-type-first** (`monitorKind` in `internal/app/monitor_collector.go`): the advertised peer type wins when known; `metadata.isRepeater` is only the fallback for repeaters whose advert hasn't been heard. A stray `isRepeater` flag must never route a chat node to the repeater collector — companion firmware has no login handler, so that poll can only time out.
- **Companions are sessionless, telemetry-only.** `companionCollector` sends one `REQ_TYPE_GET_TELEMETRY_DATA` contact request (ECDH with the static identity — no login, no password). What comes back is gated by the *remote* node's telemetry-sharing prefs (base/location/environment, optionally per-contact flags) and requires the bot to be in its contacts. `MonitoringSettings` takes a `kind` prop ("repeater" | "companion") and hides password/probes for companions; its save only writes `isRepeater`/`repeaterPassword`/`monitorProbes` for the repeater kind. Chat contacts enrol via the monitoring panel on `ContactDetailPage`.

- **Metric keys are channel-faithful.** A node's *own* readings keep clean names (`mcu_temperature`, `battery`); *external* sensors carry their LPP channel (`temperature_ch2`, `humidity_ch3`) — the channel is the firmware's stable per-sensor identity on 1.16+. Status fields are fixed names (`last_snr`, `battery_mv`). Don't strip the channel to "unify" sensors — that makes multi-sensor identity order-dependent. Frontend tiles pattern-match by type (`metricKeysOfType` in `NodeStatTiles.tsx`), so they render whatever channel a board uses; `metricDef`/`metricOrderIndex` resolve `_chN` keys back to the base catalogue.
- **Firmware channel split:** ≤1.15 lumps all sensors on the self channel (ch1); 1.16+ gives each its own (ch2+). `parseRepeaterTelemetry` marks only the FIRST self-type reading on the self channel as the node's own (MCU temp/battery/location), the rest external — otherwise 1.15's external temp collides with the MCU temp under `mcu_temperature` and is lost. A 1.15→1.16 upgrade changes a board's channel keys (accepted one-off history discontinuity).
- **Snapshot merges, never blanks:** `UpsertNodeState` merges new readings onto the stored snapshot, so a partial poll (status OK, telemetry failed) keeps last-known values; a fully-failed poll uses `MarkPollFailure` (touches only `last_poll_ts`/`last_error`). Telemetry/neighbours probes retry once in-poll (`monitorProbeAttempts`).
- **Manual poll:** `monitor.Service.PollNow` (behind `POST /api/nodes/{pubkey}/poll`) runs an out-of-band poll, serialized against scheduled polls via `pollMu.TryLock` (returns "a poll is already in progress" rather than racing the radio).
- **Overview staleness dot** derives from each node's configured interval, not a constant: stale when `age > interval + max(25%, 5min)`. The interval is exposed per-node via `intervalSecs` on `/api/nodes/monitored`.
- **List membership is toggle-driven, not data-driven:** `/api/nodes/monitored` lists the poller's current target set (`monitor.Service.Targets()`, i.e. contacts with the monitor flag), merged with `node_state` snapshots where they exist. A freshly enrolled node appears immediately with `lastPollTs: 0` (UI shows a muted dot + "waiting for first poll"); toggling monitoring off hides a node even though its `node_state` row is retained. Don't go back to listing `node_state` rows directly — that hid new nodes until their first poll and showed unmonitored leftovers forever.

`?afterId=` was added in the recent UI rewrite. `internal/store/message.go` exports `ListAfter(companionID, channel, afterID, limit)` and `routes_messages.go` honours `?afterId=` to return messages with `id > afterID` ordered ASC. The frontend uses this for delta backfill on cache re-open and on WS reconnect.
