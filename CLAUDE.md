# CLAUDE.md — project handover

A MeshCore companion + observer + repeater-admin tool: one static Go binary that
speaks the MeshCore mesh protocol, optionally bridges to MQTT (LetsMesh,
CoreScope), persists to SQLite, and serves a React SPA on `:8080`.

## Tech stack

| Layer | Tech |
|---|---|
| Backend | Go 1.26+, **no CGO**, `modernc.org/sqlite`, `embed.FS` for the SPA |
| Frontend | **React 19** (not Preact) + Vite 6 + TS 5.7, Tailwind v4, shadcn/ui (new-york), `react-router-dom@7`, `sonner`, Leaflet |
| Mesh proto | `github.com/meshcore-go/meshcore-go` v1.4.0 (plus `hardware/transport` and `hardware/sx12xx` at the same tag), pinned in `go.mod`. **No `go.work`** — add one only for lockstep library work and delete it before pushing; `GOWORK=off go build ./...` is the check |
| Real-time | WS `/api/ws`, topics `peers` `packets` `messages` `traces` `repeaterNeighbors` |
| Config | SQLite relational tables; config files are one-time imports |

## Build / run / test

```bash
./build.sh           # from the repo root; SPA then version-stamped Go binary, mirrors CI
go test -race ./...  # what CI runs (12 packages)
screen -S meshcore -X quit; sleep 12
screen -dmS meshcore bash -c 'exec ./OwlShack -vvv 2>&1 | tee /tmp/OwlShack2.log'
python3 -c "import sqlite3; c=sqlite3.connect('file:meshcore.db?mode=ro', uri=True); print(c.execute('PRAGMA user_version').fetchone())"
```

- **Never run `vite dev`** — no API server beside it; the WS and MeshCore endpoints only exist in the Go binary.
- `build.sh` skips `npm ci` when `node_modules` is in sync (`FORCE_INSTALL=1` forces). Warm build ~5 s. Type errors fail it.
- Frontend checks are ad-hoc via the Playwright MCP server against the running binary (there is no playwright config in the repo, despite what older docs claimed). No SPA CI, no frontend tests.

## Hard rules

**All SQLite writes go through `store.WriteAsync(fn)`** (RX/hot path, never
blocks) or `store.WriteSync(fn)` (HTTP handlers, blocks so the caller sees
generated ids). A direct `c.store.Peers.Upsert(...)` races the writer goroutine
and gives `SQLITE_BUSY`. Never `WriteSync` inside a writer closure — the writer
would wait on itself. On the RX path prefer `WriteAsync`: `WriteSync` blocks the
node's single dispatch goroutine and stalls all RX when `writerCh` is full.

**Migrations are append-only and shipped slots are frozen.** Add `migrateVN` to
the `migrations` slice; never edit, renumber or squash a slot that has shipped —
a released DB has stamped that version and will skip it.
`TestMigrations_ShippedSlotsFrozen` fingerprints the released SQL; a failure
there means append instead, **not** re-pin the constant. Each migration runs in
one transaction with its version bump and takes a `dbExecer`, so it must not
open its own `BeginTx`.

**Every timestamp on outgoing admin traffic comes from
`Client.UniqueTimestamp()`** (the firmware's `getCurrentTimeUnique()`), never
`time.Now().Unix()`. The companion's DMs and room posts share that counter; the
repeater node has its own `Repeater.uniqueTimestamp()`. Remote firmware drops a
timestamp `<=` the last one it saw as a replay, and treats an equal CLI
timestamp as a retry it never answers, so two sends in one second silently lose
the second.

**`internal/api` never imports the domain.** The seam is the `api.Backend`
interface ([`internal/api/backend.go`](./internal/api/backend.go)), implemented
by `internal/app` and swapped atomically via `SetBackend`. Add a method to
`Backend`; do **not** reintroduce per-feature `Set*`/mutex pairs.

**Driver pragmas use modernc syntax** —
`?_pragma=busy_timeout(5000)&_pragma=journal_mode(WAL)&_pragma=foreign_keys(on)`.
The mattn-style `_journal_mode=WAL` form is silently ignored, which once left
the DB in rollback-journal mode with no busy timeout.

**SNR is real dB end-to-end** (`snr REAL` / `*float64` / JSON number); RSSI is
raw `int8` dBm. The wire is quarter-dB (x4) and meshcore-go converts at ingest;
`meshcore.PathSNRdB(b)` decodes raw trace path bytes. No consumer divides by 4.

**OutPath semantics** on `node.Peer`: `nil` = unknown (send flood), `[]byte{}` =
direct neighbour (0 hops), non-empty = multi-hop. Route from
`peer.OutPathHashSize`, never a hardcoded `meshcore.PathHashSize`.

## Repo layout

Two independent axes: **`internal/node/<type>`** = personalities we *run* (own
identity, lifecycle, handlers — `companion`, `repeater`); **`internal/client/<type>`**
= protocol clients driving *remote* nodes (`repeater`, which also serves sensors
and rooms). A running node uses clients; never the reverse.

`main -> internal/app -> {node/*, client/*, modem, echo, mqtt, trigger, config} -> {api, store}`

```
main.go                 flags, logging, app.Run (~50 ln)
internal/
  app/                  supervisor loop (SIGHUP reload, reconnect+backoff), node
                        lifecycle, packet logger, the api.Backend impl
  config/               Config types, load/marshal/validate/defaults, legacy import
  logging/ buildinfo/   slog setup; Version/Date set by build.sh
  node/companion/       channels, DMs, triggers, templater, identity
  node/repeater/        the repeater we run: CLI, regions, ACL, adverts, delays
  client/repeater/      remote admin: login, status, CLI, path, neighbours, telemetry, ACL
  echo/ modem/ monitor/ tx echoes; KISS setup + stats; type-agnostic node poller
  mqtt/ trigger/        observer + wire formatting + JWT; triggers
  telemetry/            CayenneLPP series decoding (sensor 0x04 history)
  api/                  HTTP+WS server, routes, hub; the Backend seam
  store/                SQLite persistence + backup/restore
web/embed.go            go:embed of web/frontend/dist (must stay at root)
web/frontend/           React SPA
```

**Two-tier peer model**: `discovered_peers` (every peer ever seen, shared)
vs `companion_contacts` (per-companion, with `isRepeater` / `repeaterPassword` /
monitoring metadata). Every per-companion table keys on the surrogate
`companions.id`, so renaming a companion is safe; `node_state.companion_id` is
the lone exception (name-keyed, self-heals each poll).

Two big files remain (`internal/client/repeater/client.go`,
`internal/node/companion/companion.go`); splitting them within their package is
safe future cleanup.

## WebSocket payloads

- `peers` — `{pubkey, name, type, lat, lon, lastSeen, lastAdvertTs, snr, rssi, outPath, outPathHashSize}`; hops = `len(outPath)/outPathHashSize`.
- `packets` — `{id?, receivedAt, direction, raw, payloadType, route, pathHashSize, hops, packetHash, summary, snr, rssi}`
- `messages` — **flat, no `.message` wrapper**. Re-adding one silently drops every message (it was a real bug). Action variants: `{action:"repeatCount"...}`, `{action:"status"...}`.
- `traces` — `{companion, tag, hops, path, hopSNRs, snr}`; `repeaterNeighbors` — `{pubkey, name, snr, secsAgo}`.

The hub pings every 50 s with a 75 s read deadline. Clients may send
`{"action":"ping"}` and get `{"topic":"pong"}` — `useWebSocket` uses it to spot
half-open sockets on mobile resume.

## Conventions / don'ts

- **No CGO ever** — no `mattn/go-sqlite3`, nothing needing a C toolchain.
- Don't reintroduce DaisyUI, PicoCSS, preact-router, `@preact/preset-vite`, lucide-preact.
- Don't auto-refresh a tab on switch — it spams the radio. Use the fetch-once pattern (`forceMount` + an `active` prop + `fetchedRef`).
- Use canonical Tailwind classes; brackets only where no built-in exists. These are editor-only warnings — the build does NOT catch them. See [docs/frontend.md](./docs/frontend.md).
- Don't add per-component `cursor` classes — `index.css` has a global rule.
- Chat ordering is by row **id**, never timestamp (a remote node's clock can be years out).
- Comments: one line or none, and never a comment that only restates the code.

## Where to look first when debugging

**Go looking for state that would be indistinguishable from healthy if it were
broken.** Every serious defect found here shared that shape, not carelessness:
`packets_sent`/`queue_len` declared and never assigned published `0` — which
looks like a quiet radio; `dutyCycle` missing from `ModemSettingsChanged`
persisted and never applied — which looks applied; no handler watchdog looked
like nothing at all; a battery percentage defaulting to 100 looked like a
healthy board; and a test asserting the buggy behaviour *defended* it while
looking like coverage. Prefer "what would I see if this were wrong?" over
reading for obvious errors — if the answer is "the same thing I see now", that
is the place to look.

| Symptom | Look at |
|---|---|
| WS message missing in the UI | `useWebSocket.ts` parsing + the page's `handleWsMessage`. Flat shape, no `.message`. |
| Repeater login succeeds but stays on the login screen | `loggedIn` derivation in `RepeaterDetailPage.tsx` — presence of `pubkeyHex`. Don't change it without `api/repeater.go`. |
| Settings load shows a blank value | Wrong CLI command name. Check `CommonCLI.cpp`; there are no combined commands like `get coords`. |
| Threads list shows repeaters | `isRepeater` on the conversation row, set by `routes_conversations.go`. |
| Room posts stop mid-backlog | The push stream is ACK-gated — `handleRoomPush` must ACK hashing **our** pubkey. |
| "Works on one repeater but not another" | Different admin passwords; the Settings tab is admin-only. |
| Wrong password vs unreachable | Indistinguishable: ~10 s timeout either way, the firmware drops both. |

## Known limitations / tech debt

- Status/Neighbors auto-fetch is once per page mount; after a long absence, hit Refresh.
- Repeater and room sessions are in-memory — a restart drops every login.
- Settings-section CLI `get`s run sequentially on purpose (half-duplex radio), though the client *could* correlate concurrent commands.
- Go tests cover 12 packages; radio-facing paths are still manual. No frontend tests.
- `MESHCORE_APP_FEATURES.md` is referenced by the docs but does not exist in the repo.
- MQTT publishes RX packets only, never TX — see [docs/mqtt-and-radio.md](./docs/mqtt-and-radio.md).

## Feature ideas not yet started

No auth on the REST/UI at all (the biggest real gap for a tool that can
reconfigure repeaters) - push notifications (the PWA is installability-only) -
hosting a room server or sensor node - OTA firmware update (`start ota`) -
multi-repeater batch operations - room auto re-join on startup.
