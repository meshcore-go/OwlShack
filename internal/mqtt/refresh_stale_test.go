// A failed token refresh must drop the stale client. Its token has minutes of validity left, so

// looks spawned, the broker looks healthy, and nothing reconnects until the next refresh tick —
// by which time the token has expired and paho is auto-reconnecting with dead credentials.
//
// The retry loop this spawns MUST be stopped before the test returns. Not calling shrinkBackoff here
// is not enough: the loop reads the package backoff vars, and any LATER test that shrinks them races
// with it across test boundaries.
